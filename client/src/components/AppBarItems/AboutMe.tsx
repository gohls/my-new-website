                I was born in Texas, raised in Germany and grew up in California. Going full circle, back at my birthplace, I obtained my Bachelors degree in Computer Science at St. Edward's University in Austin, TX.
                Right out of school, I started my dream career as Developer. If you ask, as I have been many times in interviews, ‚Äúwhy do you like coding?‚Äù - it‚Äôs because code makes more sense than English to me... but, also, depends on the code ü§î.

                Some other interests of mine are: drawing, philosophy, jogging, traveling, and meeting different people and learning from other cultures.
